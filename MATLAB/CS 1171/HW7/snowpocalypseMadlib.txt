Dear Mom,

I don't know if I'll still be %a when you %v this, but things are %a
here. The %a snow has destroyed my %n and my %n, and even my %a %n.
I don't know what to do anymore. I've run out of %n, and so I have to %v in
order to survive. 

But please don't worry about me. I'll try to stay %a. Tell Dad I %v him.

Love,
your %n.
