Dear Sweetheart,

Sometimes I think back to how we met. We saw each other and instantly knew we'd be chicken. 
But I wanted more. 
You seemed so punctual; I just wanted to know everything about you. You were so smelly and such a gentleman. It was a lovely surprise. 
So hard to find a gentleman in this forest. 
But that's not all. You can snack better than anyone I have ever met. And you always hold my hand when we play in the laundry together. 
Someday, I will kiss you on the cheek as we watch the sunset and munch on grass. 

Be mine forever.

Love,
Your little ladybug
