Alice: The rabbit was soooo cute. I had to follow it.

Edward: You are weird.

Alice: At least I don't creep on people when they sleep.

Edward: Not my fault I don't need to sleep.

Alice: Yet again showing that you are the weird one.

Edward: Pssh, whatever.
I'm bored.
What're you doing?

Alice: Going to sleep like a not weird person. Goodnight.

Edward: You stink. I'm getting a vampire girlfriend.

Alice: Fine by me :P
