An Essay on Plagiarism 
Plagiarism is the "wrongful appropriation" and "purloining and publication"
 of another author's "language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions," and the
 representation of them as one's own original work. The idea remains
 problematic with unclear definitions and unclear rules. The 
modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged
 in Europe only in the 18th century, particularly with the Romantic

 ethics. It is subject to sanctions like expulsion. 
Plagiarism is not a crime per se but in academia and industry it is a
 serious ethical offense, and cases of plagiarism can constitute 
copyright infringement.
