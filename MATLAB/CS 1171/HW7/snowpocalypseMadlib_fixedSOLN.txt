Dear Mom,

I don't know if I'll still be healthy when you eat this, but things are wonderful
here. The yellow snow has destroyed my resolve and my cat, and even my pink pencil.
I don't know what to do anymore. I've run out of chocolate, and so I have to sleep in
order to survive. 

But please don't worry about me. I'll try to stay dark. Tell Dad I love him.

Love,
your muffin.
