% Directions: 
% Answer the following statements by setting the variables immediately
% following the questions with either true or false

% Example.  Professor Smith teaches CS 1371.
% example = true;

% Graph Theory is awesome and super cool. It is definitely my favorite
% topic and I am going to tell all my friends about it.
A = true;

% A "graph" in the context of Graph Theory is a collection of nodes
% connected by edges.
B = true;

% A Queue data structure follows a Last In, First Out algorithm, and is
% usually associated with recursion.
C = false;

% A Stack data structure follows a First In, First Out algorithm.
D = false;

% Prim's Algorithm can be used to calculate a graph's Minimal Spanning
% Tree.
E = true;

% Breadth First Search employs a stack to calculate a path with the least
% amount of nodes from a starting node to a target node
F = false;

% Breadth First Search and Depth First Search are usually used for
% unweighted graphs, and therefore have no guarantees on efficiency.
G = true;

% I have a really hard time pronouncing "Dijkstra".
H = true;

% Dijkstra's Algorithm uses a priority queue to calculate the minimum
% distance between two nodes.
I = true;
