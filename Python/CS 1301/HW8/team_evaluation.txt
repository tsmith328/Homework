Tyler Smith
Kamryn Harris and Weiyi Chen
I helped to code the modified special effects and provided the voice for Doug the Dancing Dog.
Kamryn was the main creative force behind this project, coming up (along with Weiyi) with the plot and characters. She also provided the music for the dance sequences and the voice for Cat.
Weiyi and I helped to choreograph and script out the scenes, and she was the main editor for the movie.
I believe that everyone contributed equally and each did 33.3% of the work.
